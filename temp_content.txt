# Bug Bounty for Open Source Issues  
## AI-Powered Issue Discovery, Ranking, Crowdfunded Micro-Bounties + Gamification

- Lets developers **claim, solve, and get paid**
- Rewards contributors with **XP, ranks, and badges**

## 2. High-Level Architecture

```
GitHub App → Issue Ingestor → Ranking Engine → Marketplace
                               ↓
                        XP / Rank / Badge Engine
                               ↓
                           Payments
```

## 5. Issue Ingestion (Copilot Instructions)

**Prompt Copilot:**

> Build a GitHub App that listens to issue and PR webhooks  
> Normalize and store data in PostgreSQL  

Steps:
1. Create GitHub App
2. Subscribe to issues, issue_comment, pull_request
3. Validate signatures
4. Upsert issue data

---

## 6. Impact Scoring

Signals:
- Dependents count
- Labels (bug/security)
- Comments & reactions

Formula:
```
impact = dependents*0.4 + comments*0.2 + reactions*0.2 + label_weight*0.2
```

---

## 7. Difficulty Scoring

Signals:
- Churn
- Repro availability
- Historical fix time

```
difficulty = churn*0.3 + fix_time*0.3 + missing_repro*0.2 + core_area*0.2
```

---

## 8. Ranking

```
final_score = impact / difficulty
```

---

## 9. Claim Workflow
